The Defibrillator Upgrade Module allows the drone to defibrillate the user, bringing them back into the fight after being knocked down. The drone will be vulnerable during defibrillation, and so defibrillation cannot be guaranteed during combat scenarios. After use, the drone will need to be recharged on board the ship.
