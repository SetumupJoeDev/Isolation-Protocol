Experiment Log #084: I have cracked it. Well, I haven't yet. But I will. I have determined the one thing missing during all of my attempts to bond with the creatures. 
And they've been trying to tell me all along! I have been so blind. So, so very blind. Tomorrow, I will begin trials involving physical contact with the creatures. 
It's not something that security will O.K., but it is necessary to our success. As such, I will have to hide myself away at the end of the day until everyone has left. 
And when they return, I will have what they want. I will have their super soldiers. An army of them!
