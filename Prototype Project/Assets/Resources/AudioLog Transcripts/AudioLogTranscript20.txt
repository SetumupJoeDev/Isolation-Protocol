*Banging*

Warden Odenmeiher: If anyone can hear this, this is Warden Odenmeiher. The prison has been overrun by mutants and parasites, and most everyone has fallen.
If anyone is coming... you'll need my override code to disable the time loop and initiate the self-destruct sequence. Be warned that under the Isolation Protocol, the self-destruct will be almost instantaneous.
You are unlikely to survive.

The code is 1-2-3-4. Good luck and God Speed.
