Officer Keyes: If anyone out there can hear this... please... do not attempt to enter this prison. Most of the people on-board have been overtaken by... *cough* by a parasite.
			   They're incredibly strong, and some have even begun to mutate further, growing massive in size. So many of my security team have been killed already... either by the parasites... or out of mercy...
			   Just stay away.

			   Ok computer, broadcast this on repeat.

Computer:	Broadcast failed: internal uplink failure. Please rectify this issue before trying again.

Officer Keyes: God dammit!
