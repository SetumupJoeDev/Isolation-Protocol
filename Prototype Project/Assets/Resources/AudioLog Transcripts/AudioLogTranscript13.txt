Scientist: Experiment log, erm... log #73... I believe: The bond I created with the Muto Slugs... has not been fruitful. Yet. 
		   I have been working with several different methods of bonding with these creatures in the last few months, and I'm sure I must be close to a breakthrough. 
		   In the mean time, the security forces have been hosting yet more "combat readiness tests", also known - by myself - as "sending lambs to slaughter". Those poor inmates don't know what's coming.
		   I overheard Officer Keyes having a conversation with her boss yesterday, they seemed to be getting antsy that these experiments have taken so long. I was half tempted to barge in and give them both a piece of my mind. 
		   But, I held my tongue and simply listened in some more. It would seem that, once ready, these creatures are intended to be sent out into the outer rim of the galaxy to quell the rioting of the civillian population. 
		   Yet another moral quandry that I musn't concern myself with.
		   I must finish my work.
