Scientist: Experiment log #001: The first batch of the parasites arrived today. My colleagues have taken to calling them "Muto Slugs" due to their slug-like appearance and ability to mutate the DNA of their hosts.
								I'm not entirely sure how well this experiment is going to go, but with the budget we have and the security being provided for us, I'm sure things will at the very least be safe, if not succesful.
								I've been working on the serum that should hopefully allow the test subjects to recieve the full benefits of the Muto Slug mutations without losing their cognitive abilities.
