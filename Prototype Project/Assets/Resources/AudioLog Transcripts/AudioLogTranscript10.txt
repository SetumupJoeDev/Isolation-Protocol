Scientist: Experiment log #021: Today I experienced something deeply... disturbing. The security team, it seems, have been ordered to test the subjets' combat capabilities. At least, that's what we were told. But when Officer Keyes invited me to watch the tests, the combatatants intended to face the subjects were no more than unarmed prisoners.
		   Don't misunderstand me -- I know what the people in here have done, what they're capable of, but setting them up to be slaughtered just felt... wrong. Officer Keyes assured me that the inmates were specifically chosen so that the punishment would fit the crime, but that aside: what are they intending to use these creatures for? Crowd control? I can only hope not.
