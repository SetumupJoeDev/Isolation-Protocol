Scientist: Experiment Log #038: Yet again, another batch of test subjects DESTROYED because of a simple misunderstanding by the security team. The subjects are not aggressive. They aren't! I've been studying them for so long now... I understand them. Their pained growls, their dejected roars, and their wistful last breaths as they are put down by the guards. I see it all now. These creatures are intelligent, linked by a hive mind, it seems. And every time the security team executes a group of them, the next batch remembers the faces of the men and women who killed their brothers and sisters. They remember me. They know me, they know that I want the best for them. We understand eachother.
