Experiment Log #005: After working some more on the serum, more and more test subjects have been able to maintain their physical integrity for extended periods. 
Unfortunately, the security team we have been provided with were given orders to shoot any dangerous specimens on sight.
If they are to kill them, what is the point in us restraining them? Do they not understand the amount of resources being wasted by-- I shouldn't complain.
They're keeping us safe, and besides, I'm not the one paying for all of this.
