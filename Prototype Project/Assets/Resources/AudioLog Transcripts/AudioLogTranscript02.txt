Guard Droid: This is a contraband check. Please vacate your cell and prepare for a full body search.

Inmate #9855: This is the 5th time I'm getting searched this week, is someone stitching me up or do you have like a computer virus or something?

Guard Droid: If you require stitching up, we can escort you to the medical bay. Do you require medical assistance?

Inmate #9855: No, I do not need medical assistance you moron. Heh, top notch tech these things.

Guard Droid: Contraband search complete. No prohibited materials found. Enjoy your day, inmate.

Inmate #9855: Ah yeah, enjoy my day. In prison. In the vacuum of space. Every day is a riot!

Guard Droid: INMATE - DO NOT INITIATE A RIOT - DEADLY FORCE WILL BE USED.

Inmate #9855: No not like that! I yeild, I yield!

Guard Droid: Standing down.
