Officer Keyes: Oh God! How long has he been like this? How many of the assets have escaped?

Security Officer: The security logs show that he stayed here last night after everyone else left. As for how many escaped, it's hard to tell. Could be a dozen or more.

Officer Keyes: Dammit, that's it I'm initiating Isolation Protocol. Contact the Warden, let him know the situation. Hopefully we can rectify this before it runs too wildly out of control.

Security Officer: Yes ma'am. What do you want us to do with the body?

Officer Keyes: Throw him into the incinerator like the rest. It's not him anymore, and we can't risk any of these parasites leaving the prison.
