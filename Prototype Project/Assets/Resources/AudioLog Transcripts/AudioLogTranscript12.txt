Experiment Log #052: I have been attempting for these last few months to form a bond with the parasites before they fuse with the hosts, that way when they awaken in their new, supreme form, they will be calmed by my presence. 
Perhaps even so much that they may be somewhat domesticated and respond to questions or orders.
This has, as of yet, been unsuccesful. However, given time, I am sure I can forge a bond with them that will last beyond their transformation.
