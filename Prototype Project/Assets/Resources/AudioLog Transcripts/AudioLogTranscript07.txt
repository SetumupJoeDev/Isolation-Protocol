Scientist: Experiment log #004: We had what I would deem a minor success today. 
           One of the test subjects, after surviving the initial genetic integration with the parasite, remained in a docile state and even seemed to understand me as I attempted to communicate with it. 
           Unfortunately, however... its physical state soon began to deteriorate.
           It seems that perhaps the serum we have created is not quite perfected. Even still, if one subject has the potential to remain cognizant after integration, surely even more do.
